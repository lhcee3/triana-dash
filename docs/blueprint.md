## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark grey (#121212) for a modern, eye-catching dark theme.
- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#42A5F5) to represent safety and technology. The hue is inspired by concepts of security and protection, but avoids the cliche of simply making everything 'police blue'.
- Accent color: Analogous color to blue, Cyan (#00BCD4), for interactive elements and highlights, providing good contrast.
- Body: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, to ensure readability and a clean interface. Headlines: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), lending a tech-forward feel befitting this use case.
- Use consistent, outlined icons from a modern icon set (e.g., Phosphor Icons) to maintain a clean and tech-forward aesthetic.
- Implement a responsive grid layout using Tailwind CSS to ensure fast loading and adaptability across different devices.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations (e.g., using Tailwind's transition utilities) for a smooth and engaging user experience.
